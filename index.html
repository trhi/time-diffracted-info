<!-- a comment is a thing that the computer ignores -->
<!-- a comment is a thing for humans to read -->
<!-- a comment helps humans understand the code written for computers -->
<!-- you can read these comments to understand what the different things mean -->
<!-- OR: just skip to <body> and start editing the peas. -->
<!-- all the stuff below, until title, is standard things you can pretty much just copy and paste -->
<!-- without worrying too much about what it means-->
<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- this tells the computer that the document type is html -->
<!-- html is the language that web browsers speak -->
<!-- web browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox) read html files (text) and make
them into fabulous websites with images, videos, etc. -->
<!-- our code says to the browser: "please interpret all of this stuff according
to the html standards that we have agreed on globally" -->
<html lang="en">
<!-- this "html tag": <html> tells the browser, the html code begins now -->
<!-- lang="en" tells screen readers that the text on this webpage is in English -->
<head>
  <!-- this is the website "header", which includes metadata about the website, such as: -->
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <!-- charset = "character set", this tells the browser to display all
  possible characters correctly on the page -->
  <!-- if not determined, results in gibberish on screen, eg. "hääyö" becomes "hÃ⁠¤Ã⁠¤yÃ⁠¶" -->
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <!-- this tells the browser to adjust the content depending on the size of the "viewport" -->
  <!-- the viewport is basically the user's screen -->
  <!-- nowadays people will navigate websites on their phones or computers -->
  <!-- so it's important to adjust the website content accordingly -->
  <title>time, diffracted</title>
  <!-- now the fun begins! -->
  <!-- whatever you write inside the title tag, ie. between <title></title> -->
  <!-- will appeare on the tab in your browser!-->
  <!-- tells the browser to get a font so we can display peas: -->

  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Noto+Color+Emoji&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
  <!-- here we link to a CSS "stylesheet", in which we can define fonts, colors, font size, etc. -->
  <!-- we can also define these things on a need-by-need basis, "inline" in the html code -->
  <!-- but sometimes, and often, it makes sense to define things for the whole website -->
  <!-- Below I write some CSS here for my document: -->
  <style>
    .noto-color-emoji-regular {
      font-family: "Noto Color Emoji", sans-serif;
      font-weight: 400;
      font-style: normal;
    }
    body {background-color: rgb(255, 189, 241);}
    p {font-size: 24px; font-family: "Noto Color Emoji"}
  </style> <!-- above I set the background color of the body of my page (the
    entire page, to this light pinkish color. Color, not colour.)-->
  <link rel="icon" href="img/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
  <!-- here we define the "favicon", what a strange name -->
  <!-- this is one of my favorite parts about making a website -->
  <!-- you create a 32x32 PIXEL or 64x64 PIXEL image (VERY TINY) -->
  <!-- and then this image is displayed as a tiny icon in the tab, next to the website title -->
</head>
<!-- this, backslash before the tag name </>, tells the browser: "end of all
the metadata things I wanted to tell you" -->
<body>
  <!-- here begins the BODY of a website, this is all the CONTENT, the STUFF
  of the website, the meat and bones. -->
  <!-- in our case: images and text -->
